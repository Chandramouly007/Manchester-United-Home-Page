# Manchester-United-Home-Page
A website page made by a fan who wanted to show his love for web designing and Manchester United.
You can open the html file to view the work that I have done. This project started out as a past time when I just finished learning HTML and CSS.
I will keep on adding new features to it to make it more vibrant and attractive. I have a few things in mind which i would implement once I start learning the frameworks such as React and Next.JS .
Anyway, I hope you like my work!

Thank you! Have a good day!
